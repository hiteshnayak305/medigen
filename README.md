At present, most of the doctors, write branded medicines, which are available in only in specific medical stores and are not sold uniformly across all places. When a patient suffering from chronic condition travels from one place to another and forgets to carry his/her medicine, it becomes difficult to get same medicine in other place. Generally, medicines are available of same composition but under different brand names. The lack of information about composition of medicine to patients causes lot of problems.

We propose a solution to above problem by building a website which provides users an interface for searching composition for branded drugs as well as list of branded drugs for a specific composition. Along with this, we provide an option to view common medicines under a category(e.g. Antibiotics). Also, website contains an option for medical store users to create an account on our platform and update the list of available medicines in their store. When an user searches for a medicine, he/she gets compostion of medicine as well as an option to view nearest store where medicines with same composition are available.
